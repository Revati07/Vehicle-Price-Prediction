# Vehicle Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the price of vehicles based on various specifications such as make, model, year, fuel type, and more. This project aims to assist buyers and sellers in understanding the fair market value of used cars.

# Project Overview

This project uses a dataset of vehicle listings to train a regression model that predicts vehicle prices. The goal is to build a reliable model using techniques like data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and more.

# Results

The best-performing model achieved an RÂ² score of approximately 84% on the test dataset. The model generalizes well on unseen data and predicts vehicle prices with good accuracy.

# Future Scope

- Integrate with a web application for real-time predictions  
- Include more features like accident history or vehicle condition  
- Experiment with deep learning techniques for better accuracy
